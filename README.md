# OTP-BYPASS
**Aim:**
The aim of this activity is to demonstrate how an OTP (One-Time Password) bypass attack can potentially be executed using Burp Suite, a web vulnerability scanner and proxy tool. This is solely for educational purposes and to raise awareness about the importance of securing online systems against such attacks.

**Procedure:**
1. **Setup Burp Suite:**
   - Install and set up Burp Suite on your machine.
   - Configure your browser to use Burp Suite as a proxy.

2. **Target Selection:**
   - Choose a target website/application that uses OTP for authentication.

3. **Analyze Requests:**
   - Use Burp Suite's Proxy Intercept feature to capture the authentication request that involves OTP.
   - Analyze the request structure and parameters.

4. **Modify Parameters:**
   - Alter the captured request to manipulate the OTP-related parameters.
   - Common manipulations include changing the OTP value, disabling OTP verification, or extending the OTP expiration time.

5. **Forward Request:**
   - Forward the modified request to the server and observe the server's response.

6. **Observe Response:**
   - Monitor the response from the server to understand if the manipulation has resulted in a successful bypass.

**Results:**
The potential results of this activity could include:

1. **Successful Bypass:**
   - If the manipulation is successful, the server might accept the modified request and grant access without requiring a valid OTP.
   - This result highlights a vulnerability in the authentication process that could be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access.

2. **Unsuccessful Bypass:**
   - If the manipulation is unsuccessful, the server may reject the modified request and continue to require a valid OTP.
   - This result indicates that the system is resilient to such attacks and has proper OTP validation mechanisms in place.

**Important Note:**
This activity is intended solely for educational purposes and to help security professionals and developers understand the potential risks associated with OTP bypass attacks. It is essential to have proper authorization and to conduct these activities only on systems for which you have explicit permission. Unauthorized attempts to bypass OTP or any form of security measures are illegal and unethical.

Please remember that the responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities to the affected organizations is the right approach. It helps in improving security and protecting users' data. Always follow ethical guidelines and laws when conducting security assessments or research.
